Common contains some useful functions which may be useful in other projects.

usefulFunctions
    Run make in usefulFunctionSource if you wish to use any of the functions in 
    usefulFunctions.h. It creates a library called usefulFunctions.a in common.
    Many of them are what you would expect to find in libc so you may well prefer
    to use that.

uart
    The uart code is based on TI's example code, but modified for my needs - mainly
    to make it a standalone module.
    The uart is bit-banged from TimerA.
    uart uses TimerA0 - 1.1 TX 1.2 RX
    uart1 uses TimerA1 - 2.0 TX 2.1 RX
    TimerA1 is the second TimerA found in certain mcus such as msp430g2553.

i2c
    Needs to be tidied before being pushed.
