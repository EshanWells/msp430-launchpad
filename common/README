Common contains various reusable libraries / source code.

usefulFunctions
    Run "make usefulFunctions" from common to create the library in common/lib. 
    All source is contained in common/src/usefulFunctions. Many of the functions
    are similar to what you would find in libc.

uart
    The uart code is based on TI's example code, but modified to make in a 
    standalone module.
    The uart is bit-banged from TimerA.
    uart uses TimerA0 - 1.1 TX 1.2 RX
    uart1 uses TimerA1 - 2.0 TX 2.1 RX
    TimerA1 is the second TimerA found in certain mcus such as msp430g2553.

i2c
    The i2c code is based on TI's example code, but has been modified into a
    standalone module. (It still needs somework.)
    1.6 is SCL
    1.7 is SDA
  
lcd_st7066
    The LCD code allows interaction with a ST7066 / HD4470 LCD. In LCD.h the 
    pins being used are defined. The only stipulation is that the Data pins
    (DB4-DB7) are on the same port on the mcu and the Command pins (RS,RW and 
    E) are on the same port. The LCD is configured in 4 bit mode. If you do not
    with to read data you can remove this from the compilation by changing the 
    definition of LCD_READING_FUNCTIONALITY to 0. Also you can tie RW to ground
    to only use 6 pins.

i2cBitExpanderLcd
    This module allows interaction with a ST7066 / HD4470 LCD via a MCP23017
    i2c bit expander. It interacts with the LCD in 4 bit mode.
