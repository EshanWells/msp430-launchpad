****** msp430-launchpad ******

Some (unmaintained) example code and experiments with TI's MSP-EXP430G2
Launchpad.

They are targeted towards the mspgcc tool chain. Porting to a different
tool chain should hopefully require little more than interrupt and header file
changes.

Directory Structure
common      Generic C code used in examples/projects.
examples    Small code examples
projects    Larger more featured projects

See projectSummary.txt in the examples and projects directories for an idea of
what is used in each "project", if you are after a particular example. 

All mspgcc code folders should be accompanied by a makefile - to build type "make"
from the terminal.

Feel free to modify and use this code as you see fit, just leave in any copyright 
details that might be in the source.
