****** msp430-launchpad ******
Much of the code will be simply me experimenting with different features of the
msp430 mcu's, and I will try to explain the code clearly. If I ever do get around
to a project I will do my best to document everything clearly, schematics etc.

Most things I will push will most likely be for mspgcc but I will make clear what
compiler was used. The only things that generally have to be changed when moving 
between ccs and mspgcc are the interrupts and potentially some header files.

See projectSummary.txt for an idea of what is used in each "project", if you are 
after a particular example. 

All mspgcc code folders should be accompanied by a makefile - to build type "make"
from the terminal.
