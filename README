Any code I copy from someone else will have their details at the top of
the source. I feel it is worth mentioning here that much of the hardware 
setup was taken from the following TI code examples: 
G2xx1 http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/slac463
G2xx2 http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/slac467

Feel free to modify and use this code as you see fit, just leave in any copyright
or authors details that might be in the source.


****** msp430-launchpad ******
Much of the code will be simply me experimenting with different features of the
msp430 mcu's, and I will try to clearly comment the code. If I ever do get around
to a reasonable project I will do my best to explain all the important details.

I intend to update this repo fairly often with smaller projects and code examples.

Most code that I write will most likely be for mspgcc but I will make clear what
compiler was used. The only things that generally have to be changed when moving 
between ccs and mspgcc are the interrupts and potentially some header files.

Directory Structure
common      Generic C code used in examples/projects.
examples    Small code examples
projects    Larger more featured projects

See projectSummary.txt in the examples and projects directories for an idea of
what is used in each "project", if you are after a particular example. 

All mspgcc code folders should be accompanied by a makefile - to build type "make"
from the terminal.
