    summary:    Some useful bits of standalone code - see the readme in the folder.

crystalTest
    summary:    Fault testing of a 32768 Hz crystal
    hw:         Launchpad + 32768 Hz watch crystal (I used a 6 pF crystal, change BCSCTL3 as required)
    compiler:   mspgcc
    code:       Watchdog Timer interval interrupts, Non Maskable Interrupt Oscillator fault

ldrAndBiColourLed
    summary:    Uses an ldr to measure light intensity, and outputs this to a bi-colour led.
    hw:         Launchpad + LDR + 56 kohm resistor + bi-colour LED
    compiler:   mspgcc
    code:       Port interrupts, Timer A PWM, ADC

wdtClock 
    summary:    Fundentals of a clock with a resolution of seconds.
    hw:         Launchpad + 32768 Hz watch crystal (I used a 6 pF crystal, change BCSCTL3 as required)
    compiler:   mspgcc
    code:       Watchdog Timer interval interrupts.
